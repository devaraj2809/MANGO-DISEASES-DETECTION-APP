# Mango Disease Detection App

## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a mobile application designed to assist farmers and orchard owners in quickly identifying diseases in mango fruits. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, the application can analyze images of mango fruits and provide accurate disease diagnoses. The aim is to create a user-friendly Android app that enables real-time disease detection, helping improve crop management and yield.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Image Processing Libraries**: OpenCV
- **Mobile Development**: Android Studio
- **Deep Learning Model**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **Deployment**: Mobile app with a user-friendly interface for disease detection.

## Key Features

- **Image Upload and Processing**: Users can upload images of mango fruits, which the system will process to enhance quality and standardize inputs.
- **Real-time Disease Detection**: The application performs real-time analysis of uploaded images to detect and classify diseases.
- **Multi-class Classification**: The machine learning model is designed to identify and categorize various types of mango fruit diseases.
